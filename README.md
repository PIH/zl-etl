Zanmi Lasante(ZL) - ETL Jobs to support reporting and analytics from OpenMRS at APZU
============================================================================

This repository hold the ETL files for ZL.

# Installation

For implementers, see [Puppet](https://github.com/PIH/mirebalais-puppet/tree/master/mirebalais-modules/petl)

### Install Java
The recommended Java version is **OpenJDK 8 JDK**

### Source MySQL databases
You must have access to MySQL databases for the instances that you plan to use as sources.
The recommendation is that these databases are replicas of production DBs, not the actual production instances, as a 
precaution to ensure no production data is inadvertently affected by the ETL process.

### Target SQL Server databases
* You must have access to a SQL Server target instance into which to ETL from MySQL
* You can use the Docker instance [described here](https://github.com/PIH/petl/tree/master/docs/examples/sqlserver-docker).

1. Create a directory to serve as your execution environment directory
2. Install the jobs and datasources into this directory
   1. For developers, create a symbolic link to the datasources and jobs folders of this project
   2. For implementers, download the zip artifact from maven and extract it into this directory
3. Install an application.yml file into this directory
   1. For developers, copy or create a symolic link to example-application.yml, and modify settings to match your database configuration
   2. For implementers, install the application.yml file, and ensure all of the database settings are setup correctly
   3. For more details on configuration options for application.yml, see the [PETL](https://github.com/PIH/petl) project
4. Install the PETL executable jar file
