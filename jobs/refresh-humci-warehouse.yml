# Each iteration uses the same partition num and site name in order to ensure data is not duplicated across
# multiple partitions if the same table is defined in multiple nested jobs (eg. lab and tb jobs)
# This will result in the same ETLs running multiple times unnecessarily, but this is fine in a test environment
# in the HUMCI run, all the tables are specified here but in a produciton environment, child jobs will be called for HIV, non-HIV etc...
